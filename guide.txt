Good one 👍 You picked the GenAI Customer Support Copilot.
Now, let’s carefully decide the approach.

🔹 “Copilot” vs “Normal RAG”

RAG = When the LLM answers by retrieving info from external knowledge (FAQs, policies, manuals, product catalogs).

Copilot = Goes beyond Q&A → it assists the agent by suggesting responses, retrieving info, and even triggering actions (like refund/discount eligibility). It can be multi-agent (one bot for Q&A, one for action).

So in this project:

If we only want Q&A from FAQs/policies → use RAG.

If we want full support assistant (like a Copilot) → combine RAG + orchestration (LangGraph) + APIs (CRM/DB).

🔹 Our Plan for Customer Support Copilot

We’ll start step by step (like you said before).

Phase 1 (MVP – Basic RAG Chatbot)

Input: FAQ docs (CSV or JSON).

Pipeline: User query → Vector DB → Retrieve relevant FAQ → LLM generates answer.

Goal: Get the RAG foundation ready.

Phase 2 (Copilot Features)

Add multi-agent orchestration (LangGraph):

Agent 1: Retrieve FAQ answers.

Agent 2: Check CRM/order status (simulate with CSV/DB).

Agent 3: Suggest next action (e.g., escalate to support, process refund).

Add fallback to Rasa: If LLM fails/confused → Rasa handles small-talk or intent-based answers.

Phase 3 (Full Copilot UI)

Build a Streamlit / React frontend where:

Customer types query.

Copilot suggests response + action.

Agent can edit/approve response before sending to customer.

🔹 Folder Structure (Proposed)
customer_support_copilot/
│
├── app/
│   ├── rag_pipeline.py        # Basic RAG setup
│   ├── copilot.py             # Orchestration logic (LangGraph agents)
│   ├── rasa_fallback.py       # Rasa chatbot integration

├── requirements.txt           # Dependencies
└── README.md                  # Documentation

🔹 Tech Choices

LLM: Google AI Studio (PaLM) OR OpenAI/GPT if easier.

RAG: FAISS / Chroma DB.

Orchestration: LangGraph (multi-agent flows).

Fallback Bot: Rasa.

DB: PostgreSQL (can start with CSV for demo).

Frontend: Streamlit (simplest to get started).

✅ Answering your question:
👉 We’ll start with RAG (Phase 1) to get practical experience.
👉 Then extend into Copilot (Phase 2 & 3) with orchestration, CRM lookup, and action suggestions.

Do you want me to set up the Phase 1 (RAG MVP) first (with folder + code + FAQs as KB), and then we’ll gradually upgrade it into a true Copilot?

sure..lets proceed
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 🚀 Let’s kick off Phase 1: RAG MVP.
We’ll start very simple: a chatbot that answers customer queries using FAQ data.

🔹 Step 1: Create Folder Structure

Inside your project directory (customer_support_copilot/), create this:

customer_support_copilot/
│
├── app/
│   ├── rag_pipeline.py        # Basic RAG setup
│   └── utils.py               # Helper functions
│
├── data/
│   └── faqs.csv               # FAQ knowledge base
│
├── run.py                     # Streamlit app entry
├── requirements.txt           # Dependencies
└── README.md                  # Documentation

🔹 Step 2: Prepare FAQ Knowledge Base

Create data/faqs.csv with some dummy customer FAQs:

question,answer
"What is your refund policy?","You can request a refund within 30 days of purchase if the product is unused."
"How can I track my order?","Go to 'My Orders' in your account and click on 'Track Order'."
"Do you offer discounts?","Yes, we provide seasonal discounts and promotional offers."
"How long does delivery take?","Delivery usually takes 3-5 business days depending on location."
"How can I cancel my order?","You can cancel your order from the 'My Orders' page within 24 hours of placing it."

🔹 Step 3: Requirements File

requirements.txt

streamlit
langchain
faiss-cpu
pandas
google-generativeai   # For Google AI Studio
python-dotenv

🔹 Step 4: utils.py (for embeddings + loading data)
# app/utils.py
import pandas as pd
import faiss
import numpy as np
import google.generativeai as genai
from langchain.embeddings import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings

def load_faqs(path="data/faqs.csv"):
    df = pd.read_csv(path)
    return df

def create_vector_store(df, api_key):
    genai.configure(api_key=api_key)
    embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model="models/embedding-001")

    # Encode all questions
    vectors = [embeddings.embed_query(q) for q in df["question"]]
    dim = len(vectors[0])

    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dim)
    index.add(np.array(vectors).astype("float32"))

    return index, df, embeddings

🔹 Step 5: rag_pipeline.py
# app/rag_pipeline.py
import google.generativeai as genai
import numpy as np

def retrieve_answer(query, index, df, embeddings, top_k=1):
    query_vec = embeddings.embed_query(query)
    _, I = index.search(np.array([query_vec]).astype("float32"), top_k)

    # Get best match FAQ
    match_idx = I[0][0]
    faq_answer = df.iloc[match_idx]["answer"]

    return faq_answer

def generate_response(query, context, api_key):
    genai.configure(api_key=api_key)
    model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")

    prompt = f"""
    Customer asked: {query}
    Context from FAQ: {context}
    Provide a helpful response.
    """

    response = model.generate_content(prompt)
    return response.text

🔹 Step 6: run.py (Streamlit App)
# run.py
import streamlit as st
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from app.utils import load_faqs, create_vector_store
from app.rag_pipeline import retrieve_answer, generate_response

# Load API key
load_dotenv()
API_KEY = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")

st.title("🛒 GenAI Customer Support Copilot (Phase 1)")

# Load FAQs + Vector Store
df = load_faqs()
index, df, embeddings = create_vector_store(df, API_KEY)

# Chat Interface
query = st.text_input("Ask me something about your order, refund, or delivery:")

if query:
    context = retrieve_answer(query, index, df, embeddings)
    response = generate_response(query, context, API_KEY)

    st.write("🤖 Assistant:", response)

🔹 Step 7: Run the App

Save your Google AI Studio API Key in .env file:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


Install requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run Streamlit app:

streamlit run run.py


✅ This gives us a working RAG chatbot that pulls from FAQs and answers queries.

Do you want me to next show you how to test this locally with a couple of queries (Phase 1 demo), or should we directly move to Phase 2 (Copilot with CRM + actions)?

You said:
before we move ahead, pls explain me :
utils.py - explain full script
also our path to faqs.csv is "D:\customer_support_copilot\data\faqs.csv". can we use relative path so that it doesnt create problem ahead.
my understanding was we first load data and Splits text into chunks then Takes the text chunks and converts them into embeddings using HuggingFaceEmbeddings and then Stores them in FAISS. So may be here we are using different embedding model models/embedding-001.
then pls explain me rag_pipeline.py. here may be we are using gemini-pro whereas in previous project we have used (gemini-1.5-flash). explain me whole code
ChatGPT said:

Great 👌 you’re thinking in the right direction. Let’s break it down carefully step by step.

🔹 1. utils.py – Explanation

Here’s the script again (with comments inline):

# app/utils.py
import pandas as pd
import faiss
import numpy as np
import google.generativeai as genai
from langchain.embeddings import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings

# Load the FAQ file
def load_faqs(path="data/faqs.csv"):
    df = pd.read_csv(path)   # Load CSV into a dataframe
    return df

# Build FAISS vector store
def create_vector_store(df, api_key):
    genai.configure(api_key=api_key)  
    # Configure Google API with your key

    embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model="models/embedding-001")
    # Here we use Google's embedding model (instead of HuggingFace like before)
    # This converts text → dense numerical vector

    # Encode all FAQ "questions"
    vectors = [embeddings.embed_query(q) for q in df["question"]]
    dim = len(vectors[0])  # vector length (e.g., 768 or 1024 depending on model)

    # Create FAISS index (vector database)
    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dim)  # L2 = Euclidean distance
    index.add(np.array(vectors).astype("float32"))  # Add all embeddings

    return index, df, embeddings

🔎 Key Points:

Relative path:
Yes, we can and should use path="data/faqs.csv". This way the code works no matter where you run it, as long as the data/ folder is inside the project.
If you hardcode like D:\customer_support_copilot\data\faqs.csv, it will break when deployed (e.g., on cloud or Linux).

Why not HuggingFace embeddings?

In the previous project, we used HuggingFaceEmbeddings.

Here, we are demonstrating Google’s embedding model → "models/embedding-001".
Both serve the same purpose (text → vector), just different providers.

Workflow inside utils.py:

Load FAQs (pandas.read_csv).

Convert each FAQ question into an embedding vector.

Store vectors in FAISS (vector database).

✅ So yes, your understanding is right: we’re still loading → chunking (not needed here since FAQs are already short) → embedding → store in FAISS.

🔹 2. rag_pipeline.py – Explanation

Here’s the script again:

# app/rag_pipeline.py
import google.generativeai as genai
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Retrieve context from FAISS
def retrieve_answer(query, index, df, embeddings, top_k=1):
    query_vec = embeddings.embed_query(query)  
    # Convert user query → vector

    _, I = index.search(np.array([query_vec]).astype("float32"), top_k)  
    # Search FAISS index to find top matching FAQ

    match_idx = I[0][0]  # Get index of best match
    faq_answer = df.iloc[match_idx]["answer"]  # Get corresponding answer

    return faq_answer

# Step 2: Generate final response using LLM
def generate_response(query, context, api_key):
    genai.configure(api_key=api_key)  
    model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")  
    # We’re using Gemini-Pro here (chat model)

    prompt = f"""
    Customer asked: {query}
    Context from FAQ: {context}
    Provide a helpful response.
    """

    response = model.generate_content(prompt)
    return response.text

🔎 Key Points:

Two steps in RAG pipeline:

Retriever (FAISS): Find the best matching FAQ based on embeddings.

Generator (LLM): Take the retrieved answer as context and produce a final polished response.

Why Gemini-Pro and not Gemini-1.5-Flash?

gemini-pro: Google’s general text model, good for reasoning/Q&A.

gemini-1.5-flash: A newer, faster, multimodal model (supports text + images, cheaper for large queries).

For this small FAQ chatbot, both work. I picked gemini-pro to keep it simple, but you can swap with gemini-1.5-flash by just changing:

model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash")


Prompt structure:
We’re telling the model:

Here’s the user query.

Here’s the context retrieved from FAQ.

Generate a helpful customer support style answer.

🔹 3. Full Workflow (Putting it Together)

User asks → "How do I cancel my order?"

Retriever (retrieve_answer) searches FAISS, finds:

"You can cancel your order from the 'My Orders' page within 24 hours…"

Generator (generate_response) takes user query + retrieved FAQ and produces a final natural response:

"Sure! You can cancel your order directly from your account under ‘My Orders’ within 24 hours of placing it."

✅ So yes, your mental model is correct:

Load → Embedding → FAISS (utils.py)

Query → Retrieve from FAISS → Use Gemini to generate final response (rag_pipeline.py).

👉 Do you want me to modify the code to use gemini-1.5-flash (so it matches your previous project for consistency), or should we continue with gemini-pro for this demo?

KEY = AIzaSyBlThsH5EMilM_FcHWx07Z9ACCCR9MgCFQ

from langchain_community.embeddings import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings 
from langchain.embeddings import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings
i have tried these 2 options to import but still giving error ImportError: cannot import name 'GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings' from
'langchain.embeddings'
ChatGPT said:

Ah 👍 good catch — this error is because the import path for Google embeddings recently changed.

Let’s clear it up:

🔹 Correct Import for Google Generative AI Embeddings

In newer versions of LangChain, the import is:

from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings

🔹 Installation

First install the Google + LangChain connector:

pip install langchain-google-genai


This package bridges LangChain with the google-generativeai library.

🔹 Example Usage

Here’s a minimal snippet that should work:

import google.generativeai as genai
from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings

# Configure API key
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY")

# Initialize embeddings
embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model="models/embedding-001")

# Example text
text = "What is your refund policy?"
vector = embeddings.embed_query(text)

print(len(vector))   # Should print the embedding dimension
print(vector[:10])   # First 10 values

🔹 Why Your Imports Failed

from langchain.embeddings import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings ❌ (old path, removed in latest versions).

from langchain_community.embeddings import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings ❌ (was a temporary path, also deprecated).

✅ The current path is:

from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings


👉 So in your utils.py, just update the import:

from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings


and you’ll be good.

Do you want me to also update the full utils.py script with this fix (so you can copy-paste directly and test)?

You said:
move to Phase 2 (Copilot with CRM + actions). we have modified something like used
from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash")
and model is working fine
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👌 nice move! You’ve already adjusted:

✅ Using HuggingFaceEmbeddings (free + lightweight, no API calls for embeddings).

✅ Using gemini-1.5-flash (fast + latest Google LLM).

That’s a solid base for Phase 1 ✅.

🔹 Phase 2: Copilot with CRM + Actions

Now we’ll upgrade our bot from plain RAG → Copilot that not only answers FAQs but also:

Looks up CRM/order info (from a mock database).

Suggests next-best actions (refund / escalate / delivery check).

Keeps multi-agent orchestration in place (LangGraph style).

🏗 Plan

We’ll add two new agents:

FAQ Agent → what you already built (RAG).

CRM Agent → looks up orders in a dataset.

Action Agent → suggests next step (refund, delivery check, escalate, etc.).

🔹 Step 1: Extend Folder Structure
customer_support_copilot/
│
├── app/
│   ├── rag_pipeline.py        # Existing RAG (FAQ Agent)
│   ├── crm_agent.py           # CRM lookup agent

└── README.md                  

🔹 Step 2: Create CRM Data

data/crm_orders.csv

order_id,customer_name,status,delivery_date,amount
1001,John Doe,Delivered,2025-09-10,120
1002,Jane Smith,In Transit,2025-09-25,250
1003,Ali Khan,Pending,2025-09-28,80
1004,Mary Lee,Cancelled,2025-09-15,150
1005,Ahmed Patel,Delivered,2025-09-12,300

🔹 Step 3: crm_agent.py
# app/crm_agent.py
import pandas as pd

def load_orders(path="data/crm_orders.csv"):
    return pd.read_csv(path)

def lookup_order(order_id, df):
    try:
        order = df[df["order_id"] == int(order_id)]
        if order.empty:
            return f"No order found with ID {order_id}"
        else:
            rec = order.iloc[0]
            return (
                f"Order {rec['order_id']} for {rec['customer_name']} is currently {rec['status']}. "
                f"Delivery date: {rec['delivery_date']}, Amount: ${rec['amount']}."
            )
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

🔹 Step 4: action_agent.py
# app/action_agent.py
import google.generativeai as genai

def suggest_action(query, context, api_key):
    genai.configure(api_key=api_key)
    model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash")

    prompt = f"""
    Customer query: {query}
    Context: {context}

    You are a support assistant. Based on the context:
    - If it's refund related → suggest 'Process Refund'
    - If it's delivery related → suggest 'Track Delivery'
    - If it's escalation → suggest 'Escalate to Support'
    - Otherwise → suggest 'Answer with FAQ'

    Respond with only one clear next action.
    """

    response = model.generate_content(prompt)
    return response.text.strip()

🔹 Step 5: copilot.py (Orchestration)
# app/copilot.py
from app.rag_pipeline import retrieve_answer, generate_response
from app.crm_agent import lookup_order
from app.action_agent import suggest_action

def copilot_response(query, index, df_faq, embeddings, df_orders, api_key):
    # Step 1: Check if query contains an order ID
    if any(str(x) in query for x in df_orders["order_id"].astype(str)):
        order_id = [x for x in df_orders["order_id"].astype(str) if x in query][0]
        crm_context = lookup_order(order_id, df_orders)
        final_response = crm_context
    else:
        # Step 2: Use FAQ Agent
        context = retrieve_answer(query, index, df_faq, embeddings)
        final_response = generate_response(query, context, api_key)

    # Step 3: Suggest next action
    action = suggest_action(query, final_response, api_key)

    return final_response, action

🔹 Step 6: Update run.py
# run.py
import streamlit as st
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import pandas as pd
from app.utils import load_faqs, create_vector_store
from app.crm_agent import load_orders
from app.copilot import copilot_response

# Load API key
load_dotenv()
API_KEY = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")

st.title("🛒 GenAI Customer Support Copilot (Phase 2)")

# Load Data
df_faq = load_faqs()
df_orders = load_orders()
index, df_faq, embeddings = create_vector_store(df_faq, "distilbert-base-uncased")  # HuggingFace

# Input
query = st.text_input("Ask me about your order, refund, or delivery:")

if query:
    final_response, action = copilot_response(query, index, df_faq, embeddings, df_orders, API_KEY)

    st.write("🤖 Assistant:", final_response)
    st.write("👉 Suggested Next Action:", action)

🔹 Example Interaction

User:
"Where is my order 1002?"

Copilot Response:
"Order 1002 for Jane Smith is currently In Transit. Delivery date: 2025-09-25, Amount: $250."

Suggested Next Action:
👉 Track Delivery

✅ Now we have a multi-agent copilot:

FAQ agent for general queries.

CRM agent for order lookups.

Action agent for next-best suggestions.

Do you want me to add a conversation memory (so it remembers order ID across multiple queries, like “What about delivery status?” without retyping ID), or should we keep it stateless for now?

lets move this to production its working fine till here
ChatGPT said:

🔥 Nice! Glad to hear the Phase 2 Copilot is working locally. Now let’s talk about moving it to production 🚀

There are multiple levels of “production” depending on how far you want to go (demo → enterprise-grade). I’ll give you a step-by-step roadmap so you can pick the level that fits best.

🔹 Step 1: Clean Up Project for Deployment

Ensure your repo has:

customer_support_copilot/
├── app/
│   ├── rag_pipeline.py
│   ├── crm_agent.py
│   ├── action_agent.py
│   ├── copilot.py
│   └── utils.py
├── data/
│   ├── faqs.csv
│   └── crm_orders.csv
├── run.py
├── requirements.txt
├── .env.example
└── README.md


Add .env.example:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


Update requirements.txt (production safe):

streamlit
langchain
faiss-cpu
pandas
huggingface_hub
sentence-transformers
google-generativeai
python-dotenv

🔹 Step 2: Containerize with Docker

Dockerfile

FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install system deps (FAISS needs gcc & g++)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8501

CMD ["streamlit", "run", "run.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]


.dockerignore

__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
*.db
*.sqlite3
.env


Build + run locally:

docker build -t customer-support-copilot .
docker run -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env customer-support-copilot

🔹 Step 3: Deployment Options
Option A: Render (Free & Simple)

Create new Web Service on Render
.

Connect your GitHub repo.

Use Dockerfile for deployment.

Add GOOGLE_API_KEY in Render → Environment Variables.

Option B: Streamlit Cloud

Push repo to GitHub.

Go to Streamlit Cloud
.

Deploy directly from repo.

Add GOOGLE_API_KEY in secrets.

Option C: Cloud Provider (Enterprise-grade)

Deploy Docker container to:

Google Cloud Run (best if staying in Google ecosystem).

AWS ECS / Fargate.

Azure Container Apps.

Scale horizontally if traffic grows.

🔹 Step 4: CI/CD Pipeline

If you want automated deployment:

Add GitHub Actions workflow .github/workflows/deploy.yml.

On every push to main, build Docker image + push to Render/Cloud Run.

Run tests before deploy.

🔹 Step 5: Monitoring (Optional for Prod)

Log all queries + responses to a DB (Postgres/BigQuery).

Add alerts for errors / failed API calls.

Track usage costs (Google LLM tokens).

✅ Suggestion: For now, I’d recommend deploying to Render or Streamlit Cloud (fastest path). Later, you can migrate to Google Cloud Run for an enterprise-ready deployment.

👉 Do you want me to prepare a Render deployment guide with GitHub Actions (CI/CD) so that every time you push to GitHub, your Copilot auto-updates online?

before we proceed to prepare a Render deployment guide with GitHub Actions (CI/CD) so that every time you push to GitHub, your Copilot auto-updates online..pls give me clarity on why this is copilot..as we have added 2 csv and it is giving response based on those 2 csv only. when we ask :
User:
"Where is my order 1002?"

Copilot Response:
"Order 1002 for Jane Smith is currently In Transit. Delivery date: 2025-09-25, Amount: $250."

Suggested Next Action:
👉 Track Delivery
why it is showing suggested next action: Track delievery. user anyhow is entering the text again in text box for any other query
ChatGPT said:

Great question 👍 — this is exactly the difference between a plain RAG bot and a copilot. Let’s clarify:

🔹 Why this is a Copilot and not just RAG

RAG Bot:

You give it some context (CSV, PDF, DB).

It retrieves the relevant text and generates an answer.

Example: “Order 1002 is In Transit” — end of story.

Copilot:

Goes beyond just answering.

It understands intent (refund, tracking, cancel, etc.).

It suggests the next best action the user (or agent) can take.

Optionally, it can even call APIs / trigger workflows (CRM, order tracking system, ticket creation, etc.).

🔹 Why your example looks like a Copilot

When you asked:

User: "Where is my order 1002?"


The pipeline:

RAG part → Looked into orders.csv, found order 1002.
→ Answered: “Order 1002 for Jane Smith is currently In Transit. Delivery date: 2025-09-25, Amount: $250.”

Copilot layer → Analyzed intent = “tracking order”.
→ Suggested Next Best Action: “👉 Track Delivery”.

💡 Even though the user could type again, the suggestion is like a shortcut or assistant nudge → making it a copilot experience.

Think of GitHub Copilot — it doesn’t wait for you to type everything, it suggests the next step.
Here, your Copilot says: “You probably want to track delivery, click here”.

🔹 Why is this useful in production

In a real CRM integration, these actions won’t just be text. They can be:

A button (e.g., “Track Delivery”) → which calls an API and shows real-time tracking info.

A workflow trigger (e.g., “Refund Order”) → which auto-creates a refund ticket in Salesforce/Zendesk.

A knowledge shortcut (e.g., “Cancel Order Policy”) → which opens relevant company docs.

So instead of the agent typing again, they just click → faster resolution, reduced AHT.

✅ Summary:
Right now it looks like “just a suggestion”, but in Phase 2+ when you wire it with CRM / APIs, those “suggested actions” become real automations → that’s why it’s a Copilot.

👉 Do you want me to show you how to upgrade your current “text suggestion” into a clickable action (button) in Streamlit so the Copilot feels real?

You already have your project in a GitHub repo.
Example structure:

customer_support_copilot/
├── data/
│   ├── faqs.csv
│   ├── orders.csv
├── utils.py
├── rag_pipeline.py
├── app.py              # Streamlit entrypoint
├── requirements.txt
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml  # CI/CD pipeline


You have a Render account (free plan works).
👉 https://render.com

You already tested your app locally:

streamlit run app.py

1. Create requirements.txt

Add all dependencies:

streamlit
langchain
faiss-cpu
pandas
google-generativeai
langchain-community


(add others if you used HuggingFaceEmbeddings etc.)

2. Add app.py Entrypoint

Your app.py should start Streamlit. Example:

import streamlit as st
from rag_pipeline import get_response

st.title("🛍️ Customer Support Copilot")

query = st.text_input("Ask your question:")
if query:
    response, action = get_response(query)
    st.write("### Copilot Response:")
    st.write(response)
    if action:
        st.write("### Suggested Next Action:")
        st.button(action)

3. Create render.yaml (optional but recommended)

This makes Render deployment reproducible.

services:
  - type: web
    name: customer-support-copilot
    env: python
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT --server.address 0.0.0.0
    plan: free

4. Push Code to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Copilot deployment setup"
git push origin main

5. Deploy Manually on Render (first time)

Go to Render Dashboard → New → Web Service

Connect your GitHub repo

Choose Branch = main

Set Start Command:

streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT --server.address 0.0.0.0


Deploy 🚀

This creates the first deployment.

6. Add GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

Create .github/workflows/deploy.yml:

name: Deploy to Render

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Trigger Render Deploy
        run: |
          curl -X POST "https://api.render.com/v1/services/${{ secrets.RENDER_SERVICE_ID }}/deploys" \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.RENDER_API_KEY }}" \
          -H "accept: application/json" \
          -H "content-type: application/json"

7. Setup GitHub Secrets

Go to your GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets → Actions

Add:

RENDER_API_KEY → get from [Render Dashboard → Account Settings → API Keys]

RENDER_SERVICE_ID → find your deployed service’s ID in Render dashboard URL or via API.

8. Test CI/CD

Push a new commit:

git commit -m "Test auto-deploy"
git push origin main


GitHub Actions triggers → calls Render API → redeploys your service.

✅ Final Workflow

You push code → GitHub

GitHub Actions runs → calls Render API

Render redeploys your Copilot → new version live automatically 🎉

👉 Do you want me to also include unit tests (pytest) in the pipeline, so that deployment only happens if tests pass? That will make it more production-grade.

ChatGPT said:

Ah! This is a classic pip “hash mismatch” error. Let me break it down and give you a clean solution.

🔹 Why It Happened

The error comes from requirements.txt containing hashes (or older cached version).

Specifically:

torch>=1.11.0 ... Expected sha256 89aa9ee8... Got e001abae...


Possible causes:

PyPI package updated → hash changed.

Your requirements.txt was copied from another environment with pinned hashes.

Some packages (like sentence-transformers) pull torch automatically, which may differ from your environment.

🔹 Solutions
Option 1: Remove Hashes

If your requirements.txt has --hash entries, remove them.
Docker builds often fail because the hash doesn’t match the latest wheel.

✅ Example cleaned requirements.txt:

streamlit
langchain
faiss-cpu
pandas
google-generativeai
langchain-community
sentence-transformers
torch>=2.0.0


Then rebuild Docker:

docker build --no-cache -t customer-support-copilot .

Option 2: Install torch separately

Sometimes sentence-transformers installs torch of an older version → hash mismatch.

Modify Dockerfile:

# Dockerfile snippet
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir torch>=2.0.0
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt


This ensures torch is installed first, avoiding mismatch.

Option 3: Upgrade pip

Older pip sometimes fails with new wheels:

RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

🔹 Recommended Approach for Render Deployment

Clean requirements.txt (no hashes, latest compatible versions).

Install torch first (if using sentence-transformers).

Upgrade pip in Dockerfile.

Example Dockerfile snippet:

FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential

# Upgrade pip
RUN pip install --upgrade pip

# Install torch first (for sentence-transformers)
RUN pip install torch>=2.0.0

# Install remaining packages
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8501

CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]


💡 Tip: Using --no-cache-dir is good for small Docker images, but sometimes it can cause repeated downloads. You can remove it temporarily if debugging build issues.

If you want, I can rewrite your full requirements.txt and Dockerfile specifically for this Copilot project, so Docker builds cleanly for Render deployment.

Do you want me to do that next?
